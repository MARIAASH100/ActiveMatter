# ActiveMatter
We used MATLAB and Python to investigate the motion of active matter modeled by Hexbug robots. The study explores self-alignment in various arenas, the emergence of collective alignment as more Hexbugs are introduced, and the impact of symmetric and asymmetric barriers on their behavior.
